# [Project 1A: Importing and Data Cleaning in Excel - Sample](https://github.com/akcfraser/Fraser_DA_Portfolio/blob/main/Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_1_END.xlsx)
* Cleaning and importing another department's inventory data in Microsoft Excel. 
* Adjusted column widths, removed empty rows, used conditional formating to identify and remove duplicate records, fixed spelling errors, removed additional white spaces, and correctly merged and formatted department names. 

# [Project 1B: Pivot Tables and Basic Calculations in Excel - Sample]()
* Formatted the data as a table and calculated the following values: SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT
* Created a pivot table that displays the Department field in the Rows section, and the Equipment Count in the Values section. Secondly, I sorted the pivot table to sort the table in descending order by the sum of equipment count.
* Created two additional pivot tables to match the aforementioned pivot table. In the second pivot table, I added the Equipment Class field below the Department field so that the different vehicle types appear under each department with their respective counts. Secondly, I collapsed all fields except the Transportation field.
* In pivot table 3, I added the Equipment Class field above the Department field so that the different vehicle types appear first, with the different departments listed underneath each vehicle type with their respective counts. Secondly, I collapseed all fields except the CUV field.
